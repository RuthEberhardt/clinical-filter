    Most variants can be excluded on the basis of their individual characteristics
    (minor allele frequency, quality scores etc), but some variants need to be
    assessed after the standard filters
        we fail CNVs where an individual has CNVs that pass the filters on three or
            more chromosomes (so we can only filter these out once we have found the
            CNVs that pass the filters).
        We fail CNVs with minor allele frequencies greater than 0.1%, EXCEPT for
            biallelic variants, they have a 1% threshold. We can only filter these
            out once we have found variants that pass the different inheritance
            models - then we can check if they are biallelelic or not.
        We fail SNVs with polyphen=benign, even if a compound pair of the SNV is
            polyphen=benign, we require both SNVs to be polyphen=not benign
